## Overview

The goal of this project is to accurately detect various types of blood cells using the Faster R-CNN architecture. The Faster R-CNN model provides fast and accurate detection by combining region proposal networks with object detection.

## Dataset

Dataset found inside dataset directory.

The dataset consists of:
- Microscopic images of blood cells.
- Annotations in the form of bounding boxes for various blood cell types.

## Model Architecture

The model is based on the Faster R-CNN architecture, which consists of:
1. **Backbone**: A CNN (e.g., ResNet-50) used for feature extraction.
2. **Region Proposal Network (RPN)**: Proposes candidate object bounding boxes.
3. **ROI Pooling**: Extracts features from the proposed regions.
4. **Bounding Box Regression and Classification**: Predicts the class and refines bounding boxes.

## Usage

### Running the Model
You can use the pre-trained model for inference on new images:

```bash
python detect.py "/path/to/source_image.jpg" "/path/to/destination_image.jpg"
```

### Training the Model
